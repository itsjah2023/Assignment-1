    <p>
      <strong>What the problem is: Some main issues found in celing fans are that sometime make alot of noise (humming, grinding) and they sometimes the blades are wobbly; which can lead to balde falling off and cause serious injuries</strong> 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Which usability dimensions suffer:</strong> <em>Learnability</em> —  New people who use celing fans will have a hard to to understand how the controls will work. <em>Efficiency</em> — a long time to figure out the controls <em>Safety</em> — Not knowing how the controls work will cause the fan to broke or balde to fly off which will cause injury 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Suggested fix:</strong> Tighten all screws and blade attachments, Clean the fan and oil the motor, Make sure fan direction is set properly

    </figure>

    <p>
      <strong>What the problem is:</strong> Many gas power stove lose a lot of heat in the air, making it less sufficent that electric and induction stove, as gas prices fluctuate, costs can rise.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Which usability dimensions suffer:</strong> <em>Learnability</em> — new users must test how to turn on and off the stove and also make sure its fully on. <em>Efficiency</em> — Repeated process can waste gas. <em>Safety</em> — burning natural gas can cause carbon monoxide which can cause irritated lungs.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Suggested fix:</strong> Install a carbon monoxide dectector near the kicthen, regularly check for gas leaks.

    <p>
      <strong>What the problem is:</strong> Air Conditioners can circulate dust, mold, or bacteria if filters aren’t cleaned regularly, Electricity bills can be expensive.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Which usability dimensions suffer:</strong> <em>Learnability</em> — installtion can be hard and someone professional would have to be hired. <em>Efficiency</em> — waste of time and money <em>Safety</em> — using air conditioner for too long can cause irritation of the eyes and skin and cause repistatory infection.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Suggested fix:</strong> Use inveter AC with high Energy Star Rating, clean or change out AC fiters once a month.
